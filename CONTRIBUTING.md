- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README / CHANGELOG and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow semver. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
